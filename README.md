- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using Python packages for statistical and visual analysis
- **Statistical Testing:** Performing t-tests and regression analyses to derive significant insights
- **Visualization:** Presenting trends, correlations, and patterns in clear, valuable visualizations
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building and evaluating models to forecast future sales
- **Churn Analysis:** Identifying high-risk customer segments for proactive retention strategies

## Analysis Process

The analysis is broken down into six sections:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Identifying and resolving issues in raw data (e.g., missing values, inconsistent entries).
2. **Exploratory Insights:** Uncovering five key insights with visualizations and explanation.
3. **Testing Differences:** Conducting two-sample tests to compare subsets of data.
4. **Inference:** Using regression analysis to understand variable relationships and impact.
5. **Prediction Modeling:** Developing a predictive model for sales prices in 2014.
6. **Churn Analysis:** Examining factors contributing to customer churn.

Each section includes detailed documentation of methods, results, and their relevance to the management team’s strategic objectives.

## Results and Insights
